        Originally from North Wales I have spent the last 15 years in my adopted
        home of Liverpool. My intrests are music, art and anything that involves
        building stuff. I enjoy keeping myself busy with projects, wether thats
        a music project, a business idea or an art project

        Outside of work my main ing is music, I've played in several bands and
        been involved with lots of different projects. My main instruments are
        guitar and piano but can play other instruments too. I enjoy keeping fit
